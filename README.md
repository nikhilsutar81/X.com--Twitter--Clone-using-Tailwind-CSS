## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm (which comes with Node.js) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd "X.com (Twitter) Clone using Tailwind CSS"
    ```

3.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Project

This project uses Vite for a fast development server and Tailwind CSS for styling.

1.  **Start the Tailwind CSS compiler in watch mode:**
    This command will watch your `css/input.css` file and automatically rebuild `css/output.css` whenever you make changes.
    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```

2.  **Start the Vite development server:**
    In a new terminal, run the following command to serve your `index.html` file.
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

    Open your browser and navigate to the local URL provided by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
